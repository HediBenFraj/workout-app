This is a MERN stack web application : MongoDb ( Mongoose for the database) Express(Node JS) for the backend set up and ReactjS for the front end.
This application is just a proof of concept using CRUD. 
You can create multiple users and associate workout exercices to them.

to make it work, follow these simple steps :
        1- after cloning the project navigate to its directory through command prompt.
        2- run "npm install".
        3- run "npm start" to start the clien side (front end server).
        4- in another command prompt navigate to the "backend" sub-foler once there run this command "nodemon server".
and voila everything should work perfectly in your browser.

In case you encounter problems, run "npm install cors mongoose" in the backend diroctory.
